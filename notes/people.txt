1 PERSONA
=========
A character's person encompasses their basic values and behaviors, as well as a rough description of their
appearance.

VALUES
~~~~~~
There are five possible values, each of which a character may hold, despise, or dismiss.

The Five Values:
- Wealth: Amass material fortunes/achievments. Opposed to people and virtue.
- Status: Respect of and power over others. Opposed to joy and people
- Virtue: Personal perfection; spiritual, mental, physical. Opposed to joy and wealth.
- People: Caring for and helping others. Opposed to status and wealth.
- Joy: Enjoy the simple pleasures of life. Opposed to status and virtue.

There
are four possible value configurations:

Fanatic -  hold 1, despise opposed, dismiss others
Follower -  hold 1, dismiss others
Dogmatic -  hold 2 aligned, despise shared opposed, dismiss others
Conflicted - hold 2 opposed, dismiss others.

The player may be presented with ethical quadries, where they must choose one value over others.
The NPCs privy to this quandry will like the player more or less, depending on which values
they hold and what the player chooses.
