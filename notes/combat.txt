===  The Core Mechanics ===
Each enemy has a preferred stat with which it attacks the player.
The player and the enemy each "roll" that stat combatant with the lower roll
takes damage equal to the difference. Combat ends when one of the combatants is
at 0 hp or succesfully flees.

to "roll" a stat, roll 1d10+2d[Stat]

=== Stat Distribution ===
06 - weak -
