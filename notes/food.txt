Goal for food:
-Player will want to eat 1 big meal per day, with 1 or 2 small meals/snacks between.
- Food + rest will be the main means of healing.
- Players profficeint in survival will be able to sustain themselves indefinitely off the land, though a series of bad fights
will outstrip their ability to hunt.
- Seeking well cooked food/spices will be worthwhile when going into town, but probably not possible in the field.

With regards to farming and towns:
- Farms can be plantations or steads
- Steads can be small, medium, or large; produce various crops
-- small: food for up to 5
-- medium: food for up to 20
-- large: food for up to 100
